### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Download Git") must be installed on your operating system.
- For Linux, run the command: `sudo apt install git`

### Instructions and Setup

**Step 1**: Install XAMPP (Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl)
- Folder: Installer/xampp-windows-installer.exe
- Website source: https://www.apachefriends.org/

**Step 2**: Install POS-58 USB Drivers
- Folder: Installer/POS-58-Series.exe
- Website source: https://oemdrivers.com/printer-pos-58-usb-drivers

**Step 3**: Install Code Editor (Sublime Text)
- Folder: Code Editor/Sublime Text Build 3211 x64 Setup.exe
- Website source: https://www.sublimetext.com/

**Step 4**: Set up Database Tables
1. Start XAMPP: Launch the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
2. Open phpMyAdmin: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin/. This will open the phpMyAdmin interface.
3. Login to phpMyAdmin: Enter your username and password. By default, the username is "root," and there is no password.
4. Create a new database: Once logged in, you will see the phpMyAdmin interface. On the left side, you will find a panel displaying the existing databases. To create a new database, click on the "New" button.
5. Enter the database details: In the "Create database" section, enter the name "PMS" for your database.
6. Click "Create": After entering the database details, click the "Create" button to create the database.
7. Verify the database creation: You will see a success message indicating that the database has been created. The new database will appear in the left panel under the list of databases.
8. Import the SQL file: After selecting the database, you will see various tabs at the top of the page. Click on the "Import" tab.
9. Choose the SQL file: On the "Import" page, click on the "Choose File" button and browse your computer to select the SQL file you want to import. -> "C:\Users\Profile\Desktop\PUP Payment Management System\Database Table\pms(.sql)"
10. Configure import options: You can leave the default import options as they are, or modify them if needed. Ensure that the character set and collation match the SQL file.
11. Execute the import: Click the "Go" button at the bottom of the page to start importing the SQL file. The import process may take some time, depending on the size of the SQL file.
12. Verify the import: Once the import process is complete, you should see a success message. The SQL file's tables and data should now be imported into the selected database.

**Step 5**: Extract the file folder named "TapAndTrack" to C:\xampp\htdocs\

**Step 6**: Open a web browser and test the system by visiting http://localhost/TapAndTrack/
